# Laptop Test:

To test the code on a computer, you should have previously followed the instructions at https://github.com/altaga/DBSE-monitor#laptop-test.

Open the Notebook.ipynb file in a jupyter notebook or the notebook.py file in any IDE that supports python.

NOTE: It is highly recommended to use jupyter notebook to run this code due to its ease of use.

## Model:

In this case we have used an existing model called YoloV3 used for object detection in addition to its own algorithm to detect the distance of objects with a simple camera.
